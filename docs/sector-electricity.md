## Sector Overview

:::tip 196.8â€“420.6 Gigatons will be saved from our [carbon budget](../glossary/#carbon-budget)
:::

![](/../static/img/electricity.png)

Electricity, once a significant greenhouse gas contributor, is now crucial to climate change solutions, as renewable sources replace carbon-intensive energy, driving sustainable economic transformations and emission reductions.

Examples:

* Renewable and zero-emission energy production
* Electrification of industrial processes
* Building electrification

The last two examples are included in what is often referred to as the "electrify everything" movement.  The goal is to switch all domestic and industrial processes (cooktops, water heaters, furnaces, industrial heat, etc.) to use electricity, which subsequently allows major decarbonization efforts to be focused on electricty generation.
